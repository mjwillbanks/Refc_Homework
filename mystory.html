    <h1>My Developer Story</h1>
<p>
    When I was a kid, computers were only owned by big corporations, and maybe a few extremely geeky techies, but they weren't common in most homes.
    
</p>

<h3>Milestones</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First exposure to code: A Commodore 64 computer and a book of code "recipes" to create artwork on the computer.
    To be clear, this wasn't object-oriented artwork. It was more like this:
    <br/>
    <br/> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX    
     <br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX X 
     <br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX X X 
     <br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX X X X
     <br/>&nbsp&nbspX X X X X
    <br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspX X 
    <br/>
    <br/> I was <b><i>not</i></b> impressed.
</li> <p>
<li> I worked a couple of jobs where I had to enter DOS commands in order to get the computer to complete specific tasks. 
    Those jobs were boring, so I decided I better get myself in school.</li></p>
    <p><li>During college, I was able to work on several Apple computers with a graphical user interface (GUI) 
        and I began to take an interest in computers again. The internet wasn’t widely accessible during this time, 
        but my downstairs neighbor was a Georgia Tech student and he introduced me to it.
            </li></p>
<p>
    <li>My first job in graphic arts required me to work on an Apple II computer. 
        There was no mouse, so I had to enter X/Y coordinates to draw a line. 
        It was a bit cumbersome, but I enjoyed seeing the results when I was able 
        to get the computer to generate what I wanted to see onscreen.
        I soon began learning graphic design software and eventually took an HTML class.
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>Throughout my career as a graphic designer, I often ran into technical problems 
        that required creative solutions. I learned to "outsmart" the software to find 
        workarounds for many of these challenges. I eventually began teaching graphic 
        design and because ours was the only Mac lab at the college and the IT staff 
        wasn’t familiar with the Mac OS, I had to learn more of the technical end of 
        it to be able to troubleshoot issues and keep our server running smoothly.</li>
</p>
<p> 
    <li>After teaching for 13 years, I bought a printing business where I learned how to 
        create formulas in Excel to automate some of my tasks, made updates to our existing 
        website, and created a new, more modern website. Frustrated with the limitations of 
        the website builders I had been working with, I signed up for a WordPress course, 
        and joined some developer networks to learn more.</li></p>
        <p> 
            <li>I volunteered for Refcode!</li></p>
